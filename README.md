## Introduction:
 
The codes rism1d_solver_homonuclear_diatomic_liquid_hnc.m and rism1d_solver_heteronuclear_diatomic_liquid_hnc solve the RISM equation for uncharged homo/heteronuclear diatomic liquid in
the hypernetted chain approximation using the Picard iterative method. The codes rism1d_solver_charged_spc_h2o_model_hnc.m solves the RISM equation for charged SPC three-point water model in the 
hypernetted chain approximation as well.


## Requirement:
Any version of Matlab

## Implementation details and running

All three codes use the Picard iterative method and you may download and run them directly to obtain the radial distribution function for the chosen physical system. 

## Copyright / License

These codes are published as freeware. Basically, you have the right to use them and modify any of them.
